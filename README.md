This project aims to be a set of libraries and tools to enable users to:

1. easily create web-based diagrams (static or interactive) for the purposes of
   teaching, viewing, and discussing games;

2. easily write AI clients for games in their preferred language, without
   spending time on the mechanics (networking, protocols, GUI, etc.)
   and spending time on actual AI instead;

3. run a server to enable local or network-based head-to-head competition for
   human-to-human, human-to-computer, or computer-to-computer agents;

4. easily create or experiment with new games or rule modifications for
   already-existing and known games.
