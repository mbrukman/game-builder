GameBuilder
===========

This project aims to be a set of libraries and tools to enable users to:

(a) easily create web-based diagrams (static or interactive) for the purposes of
    teaching, viewing, and discussing games;

(b) easily write AI clients for games in their preferred language, without
    spending time on the mechanics (networking, protocols, GUI, etc.)
    and spending time on actual AI instead;

(c) run a server to enable local or network-based head-to-head competition for
    human-to-human, human-to-computer, or computer-to-computer agents;

(d) easily create or experiment with new games or rule modifications for
    already-existing and known games.
